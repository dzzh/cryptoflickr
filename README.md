# CryptoFlickr

:warning: work in progress 

`CryptoFlickr` is a simple iOS application that queries Flickr API and presents the results inside of a `UICollectionView`. This application was developed as a part of a job application process. You can find a full list of requirements in [requirements.md](https://github.com/dzzh/cryptoflickr/blob/master/requirements.md).

You might wonder why this project has _crypto_ in its name. Well, everything is better with _crypto_ in 2018.
