        // If you want to see my app that uses the coordinators to orchestrate navigation within and between the flows,
        // have a look at https://github.com/dzzh/parkerly. The architecture there can still be improved
        // (e.g. by extracting dedicated routers and builders), but I'm in general happy with how coordinators work there.
